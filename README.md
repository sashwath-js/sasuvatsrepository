## Introduction
Hello! My name is Sashwath. I am interested in programming and wish to learn open-source development,. My hobbies include playing games and hanging out with my friends.

## What do I like most about Git?
I like Gitâ€™s ability to **track changes** and collaborate easily with others, especially the way it allows multiple people to work on code and merge changes smoothly.

## Favourite Python Assignment Problem
I most enjoyed solving the problem where I implemented a basic dotgame to play against the computer. It was fun combining programming with our favourite class pasttime.
